# SideNote

SideNote is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows you to add comments to your notes. These comments are displayed in a dedicated side pane, making it easy to review and navigate annotations without cluttering the main text.

## Features

- **Add Comment to Selection**: Easily add comments to selected text within your Markdown notes.
- **Side Pane Display**: All comments for the current file are neatly displayed in a custom view.
- **Click to Navigate**: Clicking on a comment in the side pane automatically scrolls the editor to the corresponding text location.
- **Edit and Delete**: Manage your comments directly from the side pane.
- **Flexible Sorting**: Sort comments by their position in the file or by their creation timestamp.

## How to Use

1. Add a Comment:
   - Select text in the editor.
   - **Right-click** the selected text and choose "Add Comment to Selection" from the context menu.
   - Alternatively, open the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) and run the "Add Comment to Selection" command.
   - A modal will appear for you to enter your comment.

2. View Comments:
   - Click the "Open Comment View" icon (looks like a message square) in the ribbon.
   - Alternatively, run the "Switch to Custom View" command from the command palette.
   - This will open a new pane to the side, displaying all comments for the currently active file.

3. Navigate Between Comments:
   - In the comment view, click on any comment item. The main editor will scroll to that comment's location.
